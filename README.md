## Projects

**TokoBli Twin Date Campaign Analysis**  
As a Data Analyst at TokoBli, I assessed the twin date campaigns 10.10, 11.11, and 12.12. I analyzed key metrics such as budget, transactions, and revenue to optimize our strategy. Utilizing Spreadsheets, I performed a linear regression to forecast customer yearly spending. Based on my analysis, I provided recommendations to enhance future campaigns and boost customer satisfaction.

**The-Look E-commerce Inventory and Retention Analysis**  
I analyzed The-Look E-commerce’s inventory growth and customer retention cohorts for 2022. Using BigQuery SQL, I extracted and manipulated data to conduct a comprehensive analysis. My business recommendations aimed to optimize product inventory and improve the retention plan.

**RevoBank’s Customer Segment Analysis**  
In collaboration with RevoBank's Performance Management team, I leveraged three years of customer sales data to boost credit card usage. Using Python, I developed targeted marketing campaigns through segmentation based on spending behavior, value level, and demographics. This strategy aims for a 20% increase in credit card usage and a 10% improvement in customer engagement metrics within six months.

**RevoBank’s Paylater Initiative and Propensity Modeling**  
I developed a machine learning model to predict users likely to use the paylater feature on RevoBank. Using a Propensity Model/Logistic Regression, I classified the factors that influence users to adopt the paylater option. The model successfully predicts 30% of the user base that is likely to use this feature.

**E-Commerce RFM Clustering and Revenue Enhancement**  
I aimed to increase the declining revenue of an e-commerce platform by 20%. I analyzed sales data from November 2018 to November 2019 for a UK-based online gift and homeware store established in 2007. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), K-Means Clustering, and Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) analysis, I identified and profiled the most valuable customer segments. I then tailored marketing recommendations to these segments' unique characteristics.
