As a Data Analyst at TokoBli, I assessed recent flash sale campaigns, analyzing metrics like budget, transactions, and revenue to optimize strategy. Recommendations were provided to enhance future campaigns and boost customer satisfaction.

**RevoBank’s Customer Segment Analysis**  
In collaboration with RevoBank's Performance Management team, our data analysis focuses on leveraging three years of customer sales data to boost credit card usage.

This strategy aims for a 20% increase in credit card usage and a 10% improvement in customer engagement metrics within six months.

**RevoBank’s Paylater Initiative and Propensity Modeling**  
I was tasked to develop a machine learning model to predict users who are likely to use a paylater feature on RevoBank. The result of the model can predict 30% of the user base that likely to use a paylater feature.

My task was to increase a declining revenue of an e-commerce platform by 20%. By creating segments of user persona and tailoring a suitable marketing plan for prime segments, I managed to craft recommendations based on the loyal customer cluster.
